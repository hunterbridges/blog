Welcome to *Hunter Thinks About Games*! My name is [Hunter Bridges](https://hunterbridges.com/),
and this is where I aim to post various thoughts I have about games.

I've been playing and making games for quite a while. I grew up in the 1990s, alongside the
emergence of 3D games, and I have always been fascinated by the craft and the art of game making.
Hopefully, if I meet my goal of sitting down to write a post from time-to-time, you'll
gradually get to know me through through what I talk about here.

To be honest, I do not have a super clear version for this blog yet! What I can tell you though,
is that I have a keen interest in examining game design and development choices through a
historical and cultural lens. I like to see how developers cultivate ideas across a series or
within a genre. I enjoy inferring individual impact as people change positions through their careers.
These are just some examples, but maybe they give you an idea where I'm coming from!

I do, however, think there are things that I am not seeking for this blog to be. I don't
aim to be a critic, or to convince anybody to see things my way. I also don't intend to write
from any kind of all-knowing perspective.

I just want to have the opportunity to talk about certain games, series, teams, or ideas that
have made an impression on me, and see if we can all learn something along the way!

Anyway, thanks everyone for taking the time to read my blog. I'll do my best to write something good!
